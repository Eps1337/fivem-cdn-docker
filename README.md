## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eps1337/fivem-cdn-docker.git
cd fivem-cdn-docker
```

2. Copy and edit the configuration:
```bash
cp config.template config.private && nano config.private
```

3. Run the setup script:
```bash
chmod +x setup-cdn.sh && sudo ./setup-cdn.sh
```

4. After rebooting, run this single command to complete the setup:
```bash
(cd /opt/${PROJECT_NAME} && docker compose up -d && ./init-ssl.sh)
```

5. Your CDN is now ready! Visit https://your-cdn-domain to verify it's working.

6. [Configure your FiveM server](#fivem-server-configuration) in TxAdmin.

## Detailed Setup Guide

### 1. Initial Setup

1. SSH into your VPS:
```bash
ssh root@your-vps-ip
```

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eps1337/fivem-cdn-docker.git
cd fivem-cdn-docker
```

### 2. Configuration

1. Copy the template configuration:
```bash
cp config.template config.private
```

2. Edit your private configuration:
```bash
nano config.private
```

3. Update the following settings:
```bash
# CDN Configuration Template
# Copy this file to config.private and update the values

# Project configuration
PROJECT_NAME=fivem-cdn

# Backend server configuration
BACKEND_IP=example.com # This is your FiveM server
BACKEND_PORT=30120 # This is your FiveM Game Port (Typically 30120)

# CDN Configuration
CDN_DOMAIN=cdn.example.com # xyz.example.com
CDN_PORT=30120 # This is your FiveM Game Port (Typically 30120)

# Cache configuration
CACHE_MEMORY=48m
CACHE_MAX_SIZE=35g
CACHE_INACTIVE=14d
CACHE_VALIDITY=1y

# Let's Encrypt configuration
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
LETS_ENCRYPT_STAGING=true  # Set to true to use staging environment for testing 

# Logging configuration
ACCESS_LOG=/var/log/nginx/${PROJECT_NAME}.access.log
ERROR_LOG=/var/log/nginx/${PROJECT_NAME}.error.log

# Nginx configuration
WORKER_CONNECTIONS=768
WORKER_PROCESSES=auto 

# NGINX Amplify configuration (optional - comment the line out with # to skip)
# https://amplify.nginx.com/
AMPLIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
AMPLIFY_UUID=${PROJECT_NAME}  # Optional: Will be auto-generated if not provided
```

### 3. Start the CDN

1. Make the setup script executable:
```bash
chmod +x setup-cdn.sh
```

2. Run the setup script:
```bash
sudo ./setup-cdn.sh
```

3. After the system reboots, navigate to the installation directory:
```bash
cd /opt/${PROJECT_NAME}
```

4. Start the Docker container:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

5. Set up SSL certificates:
```bash
./init-ssl.sh
```

6. After the SSL setup completes, your CDN will be available at:
```
https://${CDN_DOMAIN}
```

## FiveM Server Configuration

Once your CDN is set up and running, you'll need to configure your FiveM server to use it. This configuration enables resource caching and optional game traffic tunneling through your CDN.

For detailed information about FiveM proxy setup, refer to the [official FiveM documentation](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/proxy-setup/).

### 1. Access TxAdmin
1. Open your TxAdmin panel
2. Navigate to your server configuration
3. Find the section where you can add custom configuration

### 2. Add CDN Configuration
Add the following configuration to your server.cfg:

```cfg
# ==============================================
# CDN Configuration
# ==============================================

# Resource Caching Configuration
# This enables caching of all server resources through the CDN
set adhesive_cdnKey "your_secure_password_here"
fileserver_add ".*" "https://your-cdn-domain.com/files"

# Game Traffic Configuration
# Choose ONE of the following options:

# Option 1: Direct Traffic
# Players connect directly to your server
set sv_endpoints "your_server_ip:30120"

# Option 2: CDN Tunneling
# Routes traffic through the CDN for enhanced security and DDoS protection
# Note: May add slight latency due to additional routing
#set sv_endpoints "your-cdn-domain.com:30120"
```

### 3. Configuration Details

#### Resource Caching
- `adhesive_cdnKey`: A secure password to authenticate with the CDN
- `fileserver_add`: Enables caching for all server resources
  - `".*"`: Matches all resource files
  - `"https://your-cdn-domain.com/files"`: Your CDN's file server URL

#### Game Traffic Options
1. **Direct Traffic**
   - Players connect directly to your server
   - Lower latency for players near your server
   - More server bandwidth usage
   - Use: `set sv_endpoints "your_server_ip:30120"`

2. **CDN Tunneling**
   - Routes all traffic through the CDN
   - Provides DDoS protection for your main server
   - Hides your server's real IP address
   - May add slight latency due to additional routing
   - Use: `set sv_endpoints "your-cdn-domain.com:30120"`

### 4. Important Notes
- Replace `your-cdn-domain.com` with your actual CDN domain
- Replace `your_secure_password_here` with a strong password
- Replace `your_server_ip` with your server's public IP address
- Make sure your CDN domain is properly configured in DNS
- Choose the traffic option that best suits your needs based on your server's requirements
- To disable the CDN temporarily or remove it, simply comment out the resource caching lines:
  ```cfg
  #set adhesive_cdnKey "your_secure_password_here"
  #fileserver_add ".*" "https://your-cdn-domain.com/files"
  ```
- After making any changes to the CDN configuration, you must restart your FiveM server for the changes to take effect

## Configuration Options

The CDN is configured through the `config.private` file (not included in repository for security):

### Project Settings
* `PROJECT_NAME`: Name of your project (e.g., fivem-cdn)

### Backend Server
* `BACKEND_IP`: Your FiveM server IP
* `BACKEND_PORT`: Your FiveM server port (default: 30120)

### CDN Configuration
* `CDN_DOMAIN`: Your CDN domain
* `CDN_PORT`: Port for CDN server connections (default: 30120)

### Cache Settings
* `CACHE_MEMORY`: Memory allocated for cache (e.g., 48m)
* `CACHE_MAX_SIZE`: Maximum cache size (e.g., 35g)
* `CACHE_INACTIVE`: Cache invalidation time (e.g., 14d)
* `CACHE_VALIDITY`: Cache validity period (e.g., 1y)

For detailed information about Nginx content caching, refer to the [official Nginx documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/content-cache/content-caching/).

### Let's Encrypt Configuration
* `ADMIN_EMAIL`: Email address for Let's Encrypt notifications

> **Note:** The CDN automatically handles Let's Encrypt certificate issuance and renewal. Port 80 must remain open for certificate validation and renewal.

### Logging
* `ACCESS_LOG`: Access log file path (uses ${PROJECT_NAME})
* `ERROR_LOG`: Error log file path (uses ${PROJECT_NAME})

### Nginx Settings
* `WORKER_CONNECTIONS`: Number of worker connections
* `WORKER_PROCESSES`: Number of worker processes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. SSL Certificate Issues
```bash
# Check certificate status
docker compose exec ${PROJECT_NAME} certbot certificates

# View Nginx SSL configuration
docker compose exec ${PROJECT_NAME} nginx -T | grep ssl

# Check SSL logs
tail -f /var/log/nginx/${PROJECT_NAME}.error.log
```

#### 2. Cache Issues
```bash
# Check cache permissions
ls -la /srv/cache

# Verify cache configuration
docker compose exec ${PROJECT_NAME} nginx -T | grep "proxy_cache"

# Check cache access logs
grep "cache" /var/log/nginx/${PROJECT_NAME}.access.log
```

#### 3. Performance Issues
```bash
# Check Nginx worker processes
docker compose exec ${PROJECT_NAME} ps aux | grep nginx

# Monitor Nginx status
docker compose exec ${PROJECT_NAME} nginx -V

# Check system resources
docker stats ${PROJECT_NAME}
```

### Debugging Tools
